# MI4 Tutorial T003: No More SEO!!

__Searah Engine Optimization (SEO)__ is perhaps one of the most ridiculous secondary services in the era of the Internet.

Primarily designed to display customers' website or web page at the top of search engine results, ___using unorthodox methods___, no one is really sure of its effectiveness or the volume of business it generated since the boom of the Internet era.

Yet behind such abnomalies of the most wonderful technology that mankind cannot live without, lie several complex and yet fundamental issues that reflect the fundamental flaws of the Internet itself:

- ___No one outside the search engine company is allowed to access the search engine database!!___

You might think that this fact is as sure as the Sun always rises in the East.

But it is not!!

The breakthrough is ___DECENTRALIZED GRAPH DATABASE (DCGDB)___.

When a breakhrough requires not one but two paradigm shifts happening simultaneously, the probability of it succeeding within one year (a reasonable time in new technology development) goes down from P = 0.1 (for example) to P = 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01.

So if 

- P1 = probability of (graph database replacing SQL database) in 1 year
- P2 = probability of (decentralized user authenticatoin replacing centralized user authentication) in 1 year

Then

- P = P1 * P2
