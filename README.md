# MI4
### MI4: Metaprogramming in Forth 
### â€” from HTML to Cryptocurrencies and beyond ....

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI4

To conceive a catchy name and title has proven to require at least as much efforts and luck as the ideas themselves ....

Yet this name must have been sitting at the back of one's mind as it has been the name of a blockbuster television series before immortalized as a movie series, as well as a killer (pun intended!!) phone that might be banned by the next US presidential executive order.

And now this name might attract the brightest minds of the human societies, to venture into the deepest secrets of a branch of modern science that literally recreated the world as we know it.

It might also have been personally related to one of the greatest pioneering founder of this branch of modern science, as Wikipedia said MI4 was responsible for aerial reconnaissance, and Alan Turing's code breaking was particularly aimed at German air force during World War II.

_But we digress ...._

This page will now serve as the introductory page to a series of tutorial modules based on the Forth programming laguage and Phoscript, a lightweight portable implementation as a ___universal metascript___ to interface to ANY known programming language:
